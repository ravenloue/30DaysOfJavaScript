## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JS, CSS3, HTML5

### What I learned

I learned how to move the transform origin to a different point to have more control over how the hand rotates.

### Continued development

I want to find a way to allow a user to save mini clocks to their local storage and give the option to have multiple timezones tracked at once below their local time.
