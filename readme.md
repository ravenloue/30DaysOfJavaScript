## Overview

### The challenge

I was looking for projects to work on and stumbled across this 30 day Vanilla JS challenge. I believe that this is a great way to learn to do things without relying on external libraries, frameworks or boilerplate code. It's a free challenge available at [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com).

The creator does provide walk through videos and solutions for each day if I get stumped, but the main premise is to learn what I can during the process. I'm not going to strictly follow his solutions or tutorials as I might find workarounds that I prefer; however, any changes that I make to the base code will be documented with my reasoning for the deviations.

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript
- VSCode + LiveServer
- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

2023:
- Dec 16
  - Vanilla CSS has dynamic variables built in

- Dec 15
  - KeyboardEvent.keycode is deprecated. Using "key" or "code" is the proper way to use this functionality. This is also a more accessible option as it allows for a variety of input devices or keyboard layouts.
  - I can move the origin of transformations for an even greater level of control.

### Continued development

- ADD A MAIN PAGE that links to the other pages

- I want to add more mobile functionality to the drum kit
- Add the ability to save more clocks to the clock page
- Give the user the ability to change the image at random or add other functionality to the Variables page
