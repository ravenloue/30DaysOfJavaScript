## Overview

### The challenge

I was looking for projects to work on and stumbled across this 30 day Vanilla JS challenge. I believe that this is a great way to learn to do things without relying on external libraries, frameworks or boilerplate code. It's a free challenge available at [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com).

The creator does provide walk through videos and solutions for each day if I get stumped, but the main premise is to learn what I can during the process. I'm not going to strictly follow his solutions or tutorials as I might find workarounds that I prefer; however, any changes that I make to the base code will be documented with my reasoning for the deviations.
