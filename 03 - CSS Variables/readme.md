## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to witness changes to the spacing, blur value and base color of the border and highlighted letters by interacting with the simple UI.


### Screenshot

![]()


## My process

### Built with

-- Vanilla JS, CSS3, HTML5
-- CSS root variables


### What I learned

Although they CSS compilers are handy, it seems that those variables can't be updated after compile time. By taking advantages of the built-in cascading variables modules that were added into 2017, we can use JavaScript to make changes to the variables directly.

### Continued development

I want to try to randomize the image or find other fun ways to demonstrate this functionality on the page.
