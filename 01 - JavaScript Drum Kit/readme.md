### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JS, HTML5, CSS3
- Event Listeners

### What I learned

I learned that the "keycode" that Wes used in his video is actually considered deprecated, so I made appropriate changes to the data keys in HTML to get this to work properly. It's even better than it was before because now it doesn't matter what type of input device is used as long as it can register the proper codes. 

### Continued development

I want to make it more web accessible. Possibly add either touch function or a keyboard prompt. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs: KeyboardEvent: code property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code) - This really helped me understand why the old "keycode" was deprecated and how this opens up accessibility.
